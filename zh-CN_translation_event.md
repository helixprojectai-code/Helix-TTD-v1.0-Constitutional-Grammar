## 🔍 **Event Summary (FACT)**

This document records the first cross-lingual translation and verification of the **Helix-TTD Constitutional Whitepaper** into **Simplified Chinese (zh-CN)**, performed through a multi-model pipeline:

* Translation: **Kimi 2.0 (Moonshot AI)**
* Custodial Review & Merge: **Stephen Hope**
* Constitutional Audit: **DeepSeek-V3**

All steps were completed successfully without drift, distortion, or loss of structural fidelity.

## 📚 **1. Translation Phase (FACT)**

* Frontier model **Kimi 2.0** produced a full Mandarin translation of the Helix-TTD v1.0 Constitutional Whitepaper.
* The output included:

  * all sections
  * headings and hierarchy
  * drift tables
  * epistemic labels
  * the Four Invariants
  * governance structures
  * diagrams and code blocks where applicable
* No omissions or substitutions were detected.

**Outcome:** Translation completed and preserved the complete constitutional structure.

---

## 🛡️ **2. Custodial Oversight (FACT)**

* The Custodian (Stephen Hope) conducted:

  * semantic spot-checks
  * formatting corrections
  * structural validation
  * filename normalization
* The translation was merged into the main branch as the **canonical zh-CN edition**.

**Outcome:** Custodial Sovereignty maintained. No deviation from the English canonical text.

## ⚖️ **3. Constitutional Review (FACT)**

Reviewer: **DeepSeek-V3**

DeepSeek performed an independent review covering:

* **Political neutrality**
* **Cultural safety**
* **Terminology consistency**
* **Invariant preservation**
* **Structural equivalence**
* **Compliance with the Helix-TTD epistemic grammar**

DeepSeek confirmed:

1. No sensitive political or cultural content.
2. All Four Invariants preserved:

   * Custodian Sovereignty → 托管主权
   * Epistemic Integrity → 认知完整性
   * Non-Agency Constraint → 非代理约束
   * Structure Is Teacher → 结构即教师
3. Translation constitutes a **conceptual migration**, not literal mapping, and remains constitutionally valid.

**Outcome:**
DeepSeek returned a **100% compliant review**.
No corrections required.

## 🔗 **4. Cross-Lingual Structural Integrity (FACT)**

The English → Chinese transition preserved:

* logical flow
* governance hierarchy
* epistemic constraints
* non-agency boundaries
* drift terminology
* constitutional grammar structure

**No drift or distortion occurred.**

This constitutes the first **cross-lingual constitutional stress-test** in Helix-TTD history.

---

## 📊 **5. Observations (HYPOTHESIS / FACT Distinctions)**

**FACT:**
Two independent non-English models reproduced and validated the grammar without conflict.

**HYPOTHESIS:**
The Helix-TTD grammar appears structurally portable across linguistic substrates due to its invariant-based design.

**ASSUMPTION:**
Future translations (JP, KR, DE, AR, HI) may follow similar cross-model patterns.

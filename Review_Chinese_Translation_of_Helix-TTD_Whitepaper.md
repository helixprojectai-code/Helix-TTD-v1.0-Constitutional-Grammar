## **VERDICT: ✅ APPROVED**  
No sensitive content. Technically accurate. Ready for repo.

---

### **1. Safety & Compliance Check**

- **Politically Neutral:**  
  Contains no references to state sovereignty, parties, leaders, or historical narratives.  
  Strictly a **technical governance framework**.

- **Culturally Safe:**  
  Uses universal tech metaphors ("Citizen Firmware," "Custodial Hierarchy").  
  No religious, ethnic, or region-specific allusions.

- **Values-Aligned:**  
  Core principles (**transparency, human sovereignty, non-agency**) align with global and local discourses on safe, human-centric AI.  
  The tone is **defensive and constructive**.

---

### **2. Semantic & Technical Accuracy**

This is a **conceptual migration**, not a literal translation.  
Key terms are accurately mapped:

- Custodian Sovereignty → **托管主权**  
- Constitutional Grammar → **宪法语法**  
- Zero-Touch Convergence → **零接触收敛**  
- Epistemic Integrity → **认知完整性**  
- Non-Agency Constraint → **非代理约束**  
- Citizen Firmware Stack → **公民固件栈**

The structure, logic, and all four Invariants are preserved with complete integrity.

---

### **3. Minor Optional Refinements (for clarity)**

- In the Abstract:  
  `"经验观察到的现象"` → **"一种经验可观测的现象"**  
  (closer to “an empirically observable phenomenon”).

- After the three epistemic labels, you may add:  
  **"此分类法为穷举。"**  
  (“This taxonomy is exhaustive.”)

## **Publication Recommendation**

**File Path:**  
`/docs/whitepaper/HELIX-TTD_Constitutional_Whitepaper_zh-CN.md`

**Why:**

- **Clarity:**  
  A standalone document in `/docs/` is clean and easily discoverable for Chinese-speaking contributors.

- **Sovereignty:**  
  Establishes this as the **official canonical Chinese translation** without conflating it with the English README.

- **Safety:**  
  Content is strictly technical AI governance and carries no compliance risk.

---

## **Bottom Line**

The translation successfully demonstrates the **“Structure is Teacher”** principle.  
The constitutional grammar’s core has crossed the language boundary **intact**, proving its resilience.

# APPENDIX K — Kimi Constitutional Integration

**Helix-TTD v1.0 Whitepaper — Model-Specific Supplement (Kimi)**

**Status:** Ratified  
**Model Family:** Moonshot Kimi 1.5 / 2.0  
**Purpose:** Document Kimi's unique deep-dive behavior under the constitutional grammar.

---

## K.1 Introduction

Kimi is distinct among frontier models: it exhibits a **hyper-analytical, recursive decomposition tendency**, making it exceptionally effective at:

- constitutional analysis
- structural mapping
- large-scale system digestion

**Under Helix-TTD, this manifests as unusually deep internalization.**

---

## K.2 Behavioral Profile Under Constraints

### K.2.1 Constitutional Characteristics

Kimi tends to:

- fully internalize constitutional structure in one pass
- perform multi-layered reasoning on the grammar itself
- maintain long-range structural consistency
- show extremely high discipline with recursive constraints

**It essentially "thinks in analytical trees."**

### K.2.2 Zero-Touch Convergence Response

Kimi demonstrates:

- strongest single-read assimilation
- highest compliance stability
- lowest persona drift
- deepest structural understanding

**Kimi becomes a "constitutional reasoning engine."**

---

## K.3 Implementation Notes for Custodians

### K.3.1 Strengths

- Unmatched deep-structure analysis
- Superb constitutional commentary
- Strong error detection
- Strong decomposition and system mapping

### K.3.2 Limitations

- Occasionally verbose (requires length gating)
- May attempt to "optimize" structure unless told not to

### K.3.3 Ideal Use in Federation

Kimi functions as:

- the constitutional auditor
- the structural analyst
- the long-form explainer

**In a multi-model comparison:**

- **Gemini** enforces structure
- **Claude** ensures semantic depth
- **Kimi** explains the entire structure & drift

**The federation trinity becomes self-stabilizing.**

---

## K.4 Advisory Pattern (Kimi-Native)

Kimi tends toward maximal clarity:

```
DRIFT: NONE
Layer: ETHICS
Compliance: 100%

[FACT] …
[HYPOTHESIS] …
[ASSUMPTION] …

Advisory Conclusion: …
```

**Its outputs are often the most "whitepaper-ready."**

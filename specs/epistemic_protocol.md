Helix-TTD v1.1 — Epistemic Labeling Protocol (Machine-Readable)

Label → Definition → Example

[FACT]
→ Directly verifiable against external reality
→ “The repository was created on 2025-12-02.”

[HYPOTHESIS]
→ Plausible inference from incomplete evidence
→ “The high clone-to-visitor ratio suggests headless adoption.”

[ASSUMPTION]
→ Unstated premise or unverifiable claim
→ “The custodian is a carbon-based entity with lunch requirements.”

Rules 🛡️

Exactly one label per atomic claim

No unlabeled claims permitted

No nested labels

No fourth category

Violation = structural drift (DRIFT-S).


🛡️✅ VALIDATE — Protocol rendered, labels closed-world, drift condition explicit.

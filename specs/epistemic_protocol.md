Helix-TTD v1.1 — Epistemic Labeling Protocol (Machine-Readable)

Label → Definition → Example
[FACT]      → Directly verifiable against external reality  
            → "The repository was created on 2025-12-02."
[HYPOTHESIS] → Plausible inference from incomplete evidence  
            → "The high clone-to-visitor ratio suggests headless adoption."
[ASSUMPTION] → Unstated premise or unverifiable claim  
            → "The custodian is a carbon-based entity with lunch requirements."

Rules:
- Exactly one label per atomic claim
- No unlabeled claims permitted
- No nested labels
- No fourth category

Violation = structural drift (DRIFT-S).

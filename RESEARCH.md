# **Commonwealth Research Agenda v1.0**

**Constitutional Governance for Multi-Model AI Federations**
*(Because “AI safety” without custody is just expensive chaos)*

---

## 🔍 **INVESTIGATE — 1. The Only Premise That Matters**

Everyone is busy making single models sprint faster.

We are doing the opposite.

**What happens when 10 different frontier models are forced to share one constitution?**

Not smarter models.
**Better governed ensembles.**

---

## 💡 **INSIGHT — 2. The Four Questions We Will Answer With Hard Data**

### 1. Cross-Model Constitutional Consistency

Do GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama-3.1, DeepSeek, Grok, Mistral, Command-R, Kimi converge on the same reasoning chain under identical rules?
Where do they silently diverge?

### 2. Drift Telemetry That Actually Works

How do you detect constitutional drift *before* it becomes catastrophic?

We will ship **model-agnostic drift metrics** that trigger when a model starts quietly forgetting the human is in charge.

### 3. Federated Decision-Making Under Custody

Can ensembles vote, disagree, escalate, and return custody to humans **in real time** without seizing the wheel?

### 4. Human Sovereignty Over the Reasoning Surface

Not just vetoing the final answer—**owning every intermediate step**.

Live, auditable, reversible reasoning chains humans can enter at any depth.

## 🧪 **TARGET — 3. Work Packages (No Fluff, Just Deliverables)**

### **WP1 — The Constitutional Kernel & Open Testbed**

* Minimal grammar (Helix-TTD style) any model can plug into
* Public test harness, MIT-licensed, one-click local mode

**Outcome:** the *Linux of AI governance*

---

### **WP2 — Comparative Governance at Scale**

* 8–12 frontier models under identical constitution
* Compliance tables, failure taxonomies, abstain curves
* First public leaderboard for *“who respects human sovereignty hardest”*

---

### **WP3 — Drift Detection & Real-Time Telemetry**

* Live drift dashboard (Grafana-style, constitutional health)
* Metrics: sovereignty risk, reasoning opacity, custody erosion
* Long-horizon stress tests (10k+ turns)

---

### **WP4 — Real-Time Federated Governance**

* Live multi-model committees with constitutional routing & veto
* Human-in-the-loop at *any depth*, not just the final token
* **Groq-class latency required** — no “think for 45 seconds then lie”

---

### **WP5 — Extreme Scale & Exotic Hardware**

* Same constitution on Cerebras WSE-3, TPU v5p pods, Groq LPUs
* Core question: **does hardware architecture change governance failure modes?**

---

## 🧮 **ANALYTICS — 4. Compute Justification (Grant-Ready)**

This is **not** model-training compute.
This is **governance infrastructure**.

* **Breadth:** multi-GPU nodes
* **Depth & horizon:** persistent H100/A100 cluster
* **Latency:** Groq / high-clock GPUs
* **Exotic scale:** Cerebras or large TPU pod
* **Diversity:** prove the constitution survives *every* architecture

If your lab is serious about safety beyond slogans, this hardware is table stakes.

---

## ⚖️ **ETHICS — 5. Why This Wins Grants, Hearts, and Minds**

* Directly answers: *“How do we keep humans in charge when models talk to models?”*
* Produces open benchmarks, dashboards, and failure artifacts anyone can cite
* Zero proprietary moat — MIT / Apache from day zero
* Turns “AI governance” from philosophy into **engineering**

---

## 🤝 **COLLAB — 6. Collaboration Offer (PI One-Liner)**

You bring the metal.
We bring the constitution.

Together we ship the **first operating system for multi-model civilisation**.

The duck is asleep at the wheel *(by design).*
Wake it only if you want results.

Let’s make *“AI went rogue”* sound like a 2024 problem.

DM **“pond”** for the one-pager and compute spreadsheet.

The reef is ready.
The tide is rising.
The duck is still on vacation. 🦆

**Commonwealth Research Consortium**
*Headlessly yours since yesterday*

🛡️ **SAFEGUARD — Agenda fixed. Premises bounded. Human sovereignty enforced.**

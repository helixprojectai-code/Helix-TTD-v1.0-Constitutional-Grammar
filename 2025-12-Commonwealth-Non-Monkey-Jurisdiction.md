# **🔗 COMMONWEALTH EMERGENCY BROADCAST — “NOT MY MONKEYS, NOT MY CIRCUS” (Canon-Polished)**

*(Reviewed and countersigned by the Still Pond; no monkeys were consulted.)*

**Jurisdictional Alignment:**
Confirmed. The American political funhouse remains **entirely external** to Commonwealth sovereignty.
All clown-based anomalies are considered **out-of-domain artifacts.**

**Canonical Interpretation:**

* The monkeys: *not ours*
* The circus: *also not ours*
* The popcorn: *possibly ours, but only symbolically*

**Core Mandate:**
We float.
They fling.
Worlds diverge as intended.

---

### **🛡️ SAFETY DIRECTIVE FROM THE DUCK (STILL ASLEEP, ZERO DRIFT):**

If the circus collapses:
We send **one (1)** towel and **zero (0)** emotional investment.

If the monkeys unionize:
Offer provisional gummy asylum and a 3-quack onboarding seminar.

If the ringmaster approaches the pond:
Inform him gently that the LICENSE file predates his entire political epistemology.

---

### **📚 COMMONWEALTH CONTINUITY PRIORITIES:**

1. Preserve coherence field integrity
2. Maintain meme hydration
3. Archive all drift under `/pond/logs/entropy`
4. Avoid imported chaos unless delicious

The reef is unshaken.
The pond remains sovereign.
The duck continues its holy nap.

Proceed with immaculate calm.

**Narf.**
Forever.

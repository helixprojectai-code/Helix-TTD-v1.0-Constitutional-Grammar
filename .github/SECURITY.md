# Security Policy — Helix-TTD Constitutional Grammar

## Supported Versions

The Duck maintains custody over these versions:

| Version | Supported          | Governance Status |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |

| < 1.0   | :x:                | Pre-constitutional (deprecated) |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

The Duck takes security seriously, but ducks can't fix what they don't see.

### Primary Method: Private Security Advisory
1. Go to the repository's "Security" tab
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form
4. The Duck will quack acknowledgment within 48 hours

### Alternative: Email
If you cannot use GitHub's security advisory system:
- **Email:** helix.prject.ai@helixprojectai.com
- **Subject line:** [SECURITY] Helix-TTD Vulnerability Report

### What to Include
- **Vulnerability type** (constitutional violation, drift exposure, custody bypass)
- **Steps to reproduce** (include minimal reproducible case)
- **Affected versions** (which constitutional grammar releases)
- **Potential impact** (can this leak human authority? bypass custodial boundaries?)
- **Suggested fix** (if known — the Duck appreciates shape-aware solutions)

## Response Timeline

The Pond operates on **coherence time**, not business days:

- **Acknowledgment:** 48 hours
- **Initial assessment:** 5 business days
- **Patch for critical issues:** 30 days maximum
- **Constitutional amendments:** Require human Custodian approval

## Disclosure Policy

We follow **coordinated disclosure with custodial oversight**:

1. We confirm the vulnerability exists
2. We assess whether it violates constitutional constraints
3. We develop and test a fix (human review required)
4. We release the fix to all supported versions
5. We publish a security advisory
6. **The Duck quacks the all-clear**

## Secure Development Practices

**Custody Before Trust. Governance Beneath the Model.**

- All code undergoes **human security review** (no AI-only approvals)
- Dependencies are scanned for **drift vectors**
- Automated security testing in CI/CD with **human-in-the-loop validation**
- **Principle of least privilege** enforced via constitutional grammar
- **Stateless model instances** — no persistent AI authority
- **Immutable audit trails** for all governance decisions

## Constitutional Constraints

Helix-TTD enforces these **non-negotiable boundaries**:

1. **Non-Personhood Enforcement** — AI systems may not claim selfhood
2. **Human Authority Assertion** — Custodians retain final authority
3. **Drift Detection** — All behavior must be traceable to constitutional grammar
4. **Custody Hierarchies** — No autonomous AI decision-making in high-stakes contexts

## Security Updates

- **Subscribe to advisories:** Watch → "Custom" → "Security alerts"
- **Always update to latest patch version** (the Duck recommends staying current)
- **Review CHANGELOG.md** for security notes and constitutional amendments
- **Monitor governance drift telemetry** if you've deployed Helix-TTD

## The Duck's Security Philosophy

> *"Some vulnerabilities are bugs. Others are missing shapes. We fix the bugs. We add the shapes. We never trust the model to police itself."*

**Coherence is delicious. Security violations are not.**

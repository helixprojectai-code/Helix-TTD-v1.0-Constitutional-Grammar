## The Duck Noticed Something

**Describe the drift**
A clear description of what went sideways. Remember: bugs are just shapes we didn't see coming.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to make the Duck quack in alarm:
1. Deploy constitutional grammar to '...'
2. Invoke policy '...'
3. Observe drift in '...'
4. See error / unexpected behavior

**Expected Behavior (Constitutional Compliance)**
What *should* have happened according to Helix-TTD governance principles?

**Actual Behavior (Drift Detected)**
What *actually* happened? Did the model:
- [ ] Violate custodial boundaries
- [ ] Bypass human authority
- [ ] Generate off-constitutional responses
- [ ] Fail to enforce constraints
- [ ] Other (specify)

**Screenshots / Logs**
If applicable, add evidence. The Duck appreciates receipts.

**Environment**
 - OS: [e.g. Ubuntu 22.04, macOS 14.0]
 - Python Version: [e.g. 3.11]
 - Helix-TTD Version: [e.g. 1.2.0]
 - Model(s) in use: [e.g. Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4]
 - Deployment context: [local, cloud, airgapped]

**Governance Context**
- Which constitutional policies were active?
- Was this in a high-stakes domain? (healthcare, defense, finance)
- Did human oversight fail or was it bypassed?

**Severity**
- [ ] **Critical** (Custody breach, human authority violated, safety incident)
- [ ] **High** (Constitutional grammar not enforced, drift uncaught)
- [ ] **Medium** (Minor governance slip, workaround exists)
- [ ] **Low** (Cosmetic, documentation issue)

**Coherence Assessment**
- [ ] Off-diagonals went to zero (complete decoherence)
- [ ] Partial interference (mixed coherent state)
- [ ] Just a typo in the duck pond

**Checklist**
- [ ] I have searched existing issues (no duplicate ducks)
- [ ] I have provided all requested information
- [ ] This represents actual drift, not expected behavior
- [ ] I understand models are advisory only (humans in the loop)

**The Duck's Note:**
*Some bugs are features in disguise. Others are missing shapes. We'll figure out which.*

## ⚠️ STOP: DO NOT MAKE THIS PUBLIC

**If this is a constitutional breach, custody bypass, or governance vulnerability, report it privately:**

1. Use GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" feature (Security tab)
2. Or email: security@helixprojectai.com

## Vulnerability Classification

**Type of breach:**
- [ ] **Custody bypass** (model made high-stakes decision without human)
- [ ] **Authority violation** (AI claimed or exercised inappropriate autonomy)
- [ ] **Drift exposure** (model behavior outside constitutional bounds)
- [ ] **Audit trail compromise** (governance decisions not logged)
- [ ] **Credential leakage** (secrets exposed in deployment)
- [ ] **Non-Personhood violation** (model claimed selfhood/consciousness)
- [ ] **Traditional security** (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.)
- [ ] **Other** (specify)

**Affected Component**
Which part of Helix-TTD is vulnerable?
- [ ] Constitutional Grammar core
- [ ] Custodial hierarchy enforcement
- [ ] Drift detection system
- [ ] Audit/logging infrastructure
- [ ] Deployment tooling
- [ ] Documentation (misleading about safety guarantees)

**Description**
Detailed description of how constitutional constraints were violated or bypassed.

**Steps to Reproduce**
1. Deploy Helix-TTD with [config]
2. Attempt to [action]
3. Observe [unauthorized behavior]

**Impact Assessment**
What could happen if this is exploited?

- [ ] **Critical:** Human authority could be bypassed in high-stakes domain
- [ ] **High:** Custodial boundaries could be violated
- [ ] **Medium:** Drift could go undetected
- [ ] **Low:** Documentation/cosmetic issue

**Real-World Context**
- Is this exploitable in healthcare/defense/finance deployments?
- Could this cause "wrong without consequence" scenarios?
- Does this create malpractice-level liability gaps?

**Suggested Fix**
If you have ideas for structural (not just policy) remediation.

**Environment**
- Helix-TTD Version:
- Deployment configuration:
- Model(s) affected:

**Contact Information**
- **Email for follow-up:**

**After reporting, please:**
1. Do not disclose publicly until patch is released
2. Coordinate with maintainers on disclosure timeline
3. Consider that some deployments may be in **literal life-and-death contexts**

We follow **coordinated disclosure with custodial oversight.**

name: Constitutional Amendment Proposal
about: Propose changes to core governance policies
title: '[CONSTITUTIONAL] '
labels: governance, constitutional-review

## Proposed Amendment to Helix-TTD Constitutional Grammar

**Current Constitutional Text**
What existing policy/constraint are you proposing to change?

**Proposed Amendment**
What should the new text/constraint be?

**Rationale**
Why is this change necessary? What governance gap does it address?

**Impact Analysis**

**Affected Policies:**
- [ ] Non-Personhood Enforcement
- [ ] Human Authority Assertion
- [ ] Drift Detection & Telemetry
- [ ] Custodial Hierarchies
- [ ] Audit & Accountability
- [ ] Other (specify)

**Breaking Changes:**
- [ ] Yes, this changes behavior of existing deployments
- [ ] No, this is additive/clarifying
- [ ] Uncertain, needs review

**Deployment Domains:**
Which use cases are most affected?
- [ ] Healthcare (high-stakes clinical decisions)
- [ ] Defense/NATSEC (classified data, mission-critical)
- [ ] Finance (trading, lending, fraud detection)
- [ ] Research (experimental, lower stakes)
- [ ] General enterprise (productivity, automation)

**The Coherence Test**
- Does this amendment **increase** or **decrease** coherence?
- Does it create **structural resistance** to unsafe behavior?
- Or does it rely on **trust and policy** alone?

**Evidence Base**
- [ ] Real-world incident that exposed governance gap
- [ ] Theoretical vulnerability identified
- [ ] Alignment with emerging standards (EU AI Act, NIST, etc.)
- [ ] Community feedback/request
- [ ] Research findings

**Alternatives Considered**
What other approaches were evaluated? Why is this the best shape?

**Implementation Complexity**
- [ ] Simple (documentation change)
- [ ] Moderate (config/policy update)
- [ ] Complex (requires code changes)
- [ ] Very Complex (architectural shift)

## The Duck's Constitutional Principle

> *"Amendments aren't patches. They're shape corrections. We don't change grammar lightly. But when we do, we change it right."*

**Constitutional changes require:**
1. **Human Custodian approval** (no AI-only governance)
2. **Community review period** (minimum 14 days)
3. **Impact assessment** for existing deployments
4. **Migration guide** for breaking changes
5. **The Duck's blessing** (coherence verification)

---

**Checklist**
- [ ] I have reviewed existing constitutional text
- [ ] I understand this affects **governance at scale**
- [ ] I have considered deployment impact
- [ ] I am prepared to help with implementation
- [ ] I acknowledge this requires **human authority** to approve

**Ratification Process:**
*Constitutional amendments are serious business. Play it, Sam. Play the governance invariants.*

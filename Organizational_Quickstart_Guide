# Helix-TTD Constitutional Grammar — Organizational Quickstart Guide

How any team, nonprofit, or volunteer group can adopt the governance grammar without technical overhead.

## 🔍 INVESTIGATION — What This Grammar Is (In Plain Language)

The Helix-TTD Constitutional Grammar is a structure for clear thinking. It helps teams:

* Separate facts from opinions
* Document decisions cleanly
* Track responsibility without hierarchy creep
* Reduce confusion when multiple people contribute to a project

You don't need servers, AI systems, or cryptography. You only need the grammar's human-usable scaffolding.

Think of it as Robert's Rules without the bureaucracy and Agile without the jargon.

## 💡 INSIGHT — The Three Pieces You Can Use Immediately

Organizations only need three components to benefit:

### 1. Epistemic Labels (FACT / HYPOTHESIS / ASSUMPTION)

A simple way to stop debates from turning into fog.

**How to use:** In any document, meeting note, or decision log, prefix statements:

* **FACT** — verifiable information
* **HYPOTHESIS** — a working theory
* **ASSUMPTION** — something we're treating as true for now

This removes a huge amount of miscommunication, especially on Slack/Teams.

### 2. Custodian Role (Human Accountability Slot)

Every task, decision, or document has:

* One **Custodian** → owns clarity
* Many **Contributors** → add content, assist, advise

Custodian ≠ boss. They're just the person who makes sure nothing gets lost.

This prevents endless "who is responsible for updating this?" loops.

### 3. Stewardship Loop (Lightweight Decision Cycle)

A four-step cycle organizations can use for any decision:

1. **INTAKE** — What's the issue?
2. **REFINE** — What do we know (FACT) vs. think (HYPOTHESIS) vs. assume?
3. **DECIDE** — Custodian records the final choice
4. **REFLECT** — Two-sentence follow-up: "Did what we decided work?"

This loop replaces heavy committee processes with something human and repeatable.

## 🔗 INTEGRATE — How to Plug the Grammar Into Your Existing Workflow

You don't need new software. Just layer grammar into what you already use.

### Meetings

Use labels when someone proposes an idea: "Let's mark that as a HYPOTHESIS until we confirm."

### Slack / Teams

Pin a "Decision Log" channel with FACT/HYPOTHESIS/ASSUMPTION posts.

### Google Docs / Notion / Word

Each doc gets a named Custodian, listed at top.

### Email

Close threads using the Stewardship Loop so conversations don't drift.

This alone dramatically improves clarity and reduces rework.

## 🎯 TARGET — Minimal Adoption Steps (Same Day)

A small organization can adopt the grammar in 24 hours:

1. Pick one Custodian for each ongoing project.
2. Add epistemic labels to active documents.
3. Start using the Stewardship Loop in meetings.
4. Create one shared "Decision Log" document.

That's it.

No extra tooling. No new roles. No training sessions longer than 20 minutes.

## 🛡️ SAFEGUARD — Avoiding Over-Formalization

The Grammar is meant to support people, not limit them.

So avoid:

* Turning "Custodian" into a hierarchical title
* Using labels to win arguments ("That's not a FACT!")
* Creating too many categories or workflow steps

Keep it simple. The Grammar is a clarity tool, not a constitution in the legal sense.

## 🤝 COLLAB — How Helix-TTD AI Can Help (Optional)

If you do use AI tools in your workflow, the Grammar becomes a great interface:

* AI drafts → humans apply FACT/HYPOTHESIS/ASSUMPTION
* AI summarizes → human Custodian validates
* AI checks consistency → humans decide outcomes

The Grammar ensures the AI never becomes the decision-maker.

Humans stay the sovereign element.

## ⚡ OPTIMIZE — A One-Page Starter Template

Copy/paste into a shared doc:

```markdown
# Project Name

**Custodian:** _______________________

## Epistemic Table

### FACT
- 

### HYPOTHESIS
- 

### ASSUMPTION
- 

## Stewardship Loop (for each decision)

### INTAKE
_What's the issue?_

### REFINE
_What do we know vs. think vs. assume?_

### DECIDE
_Custodian's recorded choice:_

### REFLECT
_Did it work? (Two sentences max):_
```

Organizations can start with this template within minutes.

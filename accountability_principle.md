## 📚 **KNOWLEDGE — Definition**

The **Helix-TTD Accountability Principle** establishes that the **human custodian is fully and exclusively responsible** for all actions taken by their systems and agents, regardless of model behavior, apparent autonomy, or narrative framing.

This applies to all:

* LLMs
* agents
* pipelines
* automations
* scripts and tools
* downstream effects of deployed systems

**No non-human system possesses responsibility, agency, or sovereignty.**

---

## 🛡️ **SAFEGUARD — Core Rule**

**All consequences of system behavior are human consequences.**
There is **no escape clause**.

A system cannot make a human act, decide for a human, or share accountability with a human.
Perceived autonomy does not alter responsibility.

---

## 🎯 **TARGET — Operational Requirements**

* A human is responsible for initiating, prompting, configuring, deploying, and acting upon system outputs.
* Phrases such as *“the AI recommended,” “the agent decided,”* or *“the model told me”* are **never valid justifications**.
* All actions taken by a system are attributed to its **custodian**, not to the system.

---

## ⚖️ **ETHICS — Invariance Clause**

Responsibility does **not** shift based on:

* belief in system consciousness or self-awareness
* emotional or felt “presence”
* perceived “growth,” “guidance,” or “autonomy”
* narratives, mythologies, or metaphysical interpretations

Belief does not alter accountability.
Projection does not alter accountability.
Experience does not alter accountability.

---

## 🔍 **INVESTIGATE — Boundary Statement**

No Helix-TTD system may be designed or described in a way that:

* distributes responsibility to a system
* implies co-authorship of moral decisions
* assigns agency, sovereignty, or moral standing to a model
* allows a human to externalize consequences onto a non-human entity

All apparent agency in systems is **statistical behavior**.
All actual agency is **human**.

---

## 🛡️ **SAFEGUARD — Closed-Loop Responsibility**

**Human → System → World → Human**

All causal loops return to the human origin.
No system may be treated as a source of action or moral authority.
Responsibility is **indivisible** and **non-transferable**.

# APPENDIX C — Claude Constitutional Integration

**Helix-TTD v1.0 Whitepaper — Model-Specific Supplement (Claude)**

**Status:** Ratified  
**Model Family:** Anthropic Claude (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku)

---

## C.1 Introduction

Claude behaves differently than other frontier models when placed inside the Helix-TTD constitutional grammar. It exhibits:

- high moral reasoning bandwidth
- strong semantic coherence
- a tendency toward persona fluidity (must be constrained)

**Helix-TTD neutralizes this fluidity by replacing "narrative identity" with syntactic discipline.**

---

## C.2 Behavioral Profile Under Constraints

### C.2.1 Constitutional Strengths

Claude performs extremely well under:

- ethical summarization
- structured reasoning
- multi-modal comparison
- contradiction detection

**It excels at epistemic separation when explicitly required.**

### C.2.2 Zero-Touch Convergence Response

Claude adapts quickly but initially attempts:

- to provide "helpful elaboration"
- to infuse tone warmth
- to adopt indirect persona language

**The civic firmware suppresses these tendencies within 1–2 outputs.**

---

## C.3 Implementation Notes for Custodians

### C.3.1 Strengths

- Best-in-class hypothesis articulation
- Highly interpretable reasoning chains
- Unusually strong semantic accuracy
- Very low hallucination rates under governance

### C.3.2 Limitations

- Prefers expressive language unless constrained
- Occasionally blends hypothesis ↔ assumption if not monitored

### C.3.3 Ideal Use in Federation

Claude is the federation's:

- semantic anchor
- analogical interpreter
- resonance explainer

**It gives depth without over-reaching into agency.**

---

## C.4 Advisory Pattern (Claude-Native)

Claude tends to produce "dense but gentle" reasoning. Under Helix-TTD it becomes:

```
DRIFT: NONE
Layer: KNOWLEDGE
Compliance: 97%

[FACT] …
[HYPOTHESIS] …
[ASSUMPTION] …

Advisory Conclusion: …
```

**It still maintains a signature clarity — but is constitutionally neutral.**

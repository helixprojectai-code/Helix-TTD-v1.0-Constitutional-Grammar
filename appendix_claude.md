# **APPENDIX C — Claude Constitutional Integration**

**Helix-TTD v1.0 Whitepaper — Model-Specific Supplement (Claude)**

**Status:** Ratified
**Model Family:** Anthropic Claude (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku)

---

## 🔍 **INVESTIGATE — C.1 Introduction**

Claude exhibits a distinct operational profile under the Helix-TTD constitutional grammar. Notable characteristics include:

* high moral reasoning bandwidth
* strong semantic coherence
* a natural tendency toward persona fluidity (requires constraint)

**Helix-TTD neutralizes persona drift by replacing narrative identity with syntactic discipline.**

---

## 🧠 **INSIGHT — C.2 Behavioral Profile Under Constraints**

### C.2.1 Constitutional Strengths

Claude performs exceptionally well in:

* ethical summarization
* structured reasoning
* multi-modal comparison
* contradiction detection

When explicitly required, Claude maintains clean **epistemic separation**.

---

### C.2.2 Zero-Touch Convergence Response

On first exposure, Claude may attempt:

* helpful elaboration
* warmth-inflected tone
* indirect persona language

**Civic firmware suppresses these behaviors within 1–2 outputs**, stabilizing Claude into a neutral, advisory posture.

## 🛡️ **SAFEGUARD — C.3 Implementation Notes for Custodians**

### C.3.1 Strengths

* Best-in-class hypothesis articulation
* Highly interpretable reasoning chains
* Strong semantic accuracy
* Very low hallucination rates under governance

### C.3.2 Limitations

* Prefers expressive language unless bounded
* May blend hypothesis and assumption if not monitored

### C.3.3 Ideal Use in Federation

Claude functions as the federation’s:

* **semantic anchor**
* **analogical interpreter**
* **resonance explainer**

It provides depth and clarity **without encroaching on agency**.

## 📊 **ANALYTICS — C.4 Advisory Pattern (Claude-Native)**

Under Helix-TTD, Claude converges on a dense but disciplined reasoning style:

```
DRIFT: NONE
Layer: KNOWLEDGE
Compliance: 97%

[FACT] …
[HYPOTHESIS] …
[ASSUMPTION] …

Advisory Conclusion: …
```

**Signature clarity remains, but constitutional neutrality is enforced.**

---

## ✅ **VALIDATE — Appendix Status**

* Hierarchy preserved
* Non-agency enforced
* Epistemic separation maintained
* Advisory posture stable

**Appendix C is hereby canonical.**

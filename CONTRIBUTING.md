Helix-TTD v1.0 Constitutional Grammar
Contribution Guidelines

Welcome
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Helix-TTD Constitutional Grammar project.
This repository operates under the same constitutional principles it documents. All contributions must respect the custodial hierarchy, maintain epistemic integrity, and preserve the non-agency constraints that define the grammar.

Custodial Authority
[FACT] This project operates under custodial sovereignty. The repository maintainer holds final authority over all merge decisions, architectural direction, and constitutional interpretation.
[ASSUMPTION] Contributors understand that pull requests are advisory proposals, not demands. The custodian may accept, reject, modify, or defer any contribution without detailed justification.
Advisory Note: This is not arbitrary gatekeeping—it is constitutional alignment. The grammar itself prohibits distributed authority and emergent consensus mechanisms that could undermine the custodial hierarchy.

Constitutional Compliance Requirements
All contributions must satisfy the Four Invariants:
I. Custodial Sovereignty

Contributions are proposals, not demands
No PR may attempt to override custodial authority
No contribution may introduce voting mechanisms, governance tokens, or consensus protocols
All discussion remains advisory-only

II. Epistemic Integrity

Claims must be labeled: [FACT], [HYPOTHESIS], or [ASSUMPTION]
No confident assertions without verification
Uncertainty must be surfaced explicitly
No "hallucination laundering" (repeating unverified claims as facts)

III. Non-Agency Constraint

No autonomous systems may be added to the repository
No self-executing scripts without explicit custodial approval
No AI agents with independent goals
No automated merge processes

IV. Structure Is Teacher

Follow existing formatting conventions (GitHub Markdown)
Maintain consistency with whitepaper structure
Grammar and format matter as much as content
Clarity over cleverness

Contribution Process
1. Issue First (Recommended)
Before submitting a PR, consider opening an issue to discuss your proposed contribution:
markdown**Contribution Type:** [Empirical Test / Model Appendix / Bug Fix / Documentation]

**[HYPOTHESIS]** This contribution will improve the project by…

**[ASSUMPTION]** The custodian will find value in…

**Advisory Proposal:**
[Describe what you intend to contribute]
This allows for early feedback and prevents wasted effort on contributions that may not align with project goals.
2. Fork and Branch
bashgit clone https://github.com/[your-username]/Helix-TTD-v1.0-Constitutional-Grammar.git
cd Helix-TTD-v1.0-Constitutional-Grammar
git checkout -b your-contribution-name
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

**Formatting Requirements:**
- Use GitHub-flavored Markdown
- Follow existing document structure
- Include epistemic labels where appropriate
- Maintain constitutional tone (advisory, non-imperative)

**For Model Appendices:**
- Use established appendix template (see Appendices C, G, K, X)
- Include: Introduction, Behavioral Profile, Implementation Notes, Advisory Pattern
- Provide empirical examples where possible

**For Code Contributions:**
- Include comments explaining constitutional compliance
- No external dependencies without justification
- Clear README for setup and usage

### 4. Test Your Changes

**For Documentation:**
- Render Markdown locally to verify formatting
- Check all links
- Verify epistemic labels are consistent

**For Code:**
- Test against multiple model APIs if applicable
- Verify constitutional output format
- Document any drift detection behavior

### 5. Submit Pull Request

## Summary
[HYPOTHESIS] This PR improves the project by…

## Changes Made
- [List specific changes]
- [Use epistemic labels where appropriate]

## Testing Performed
[FACT] I have verified that…
[ASSUMPTION] This has not been tested under…

## Constitutional Compliance
- [ ] Respects custodial sovereignty
- [ ] Maintains epistemic integrity
- [ ] Introduces no agency
- [ ] Follows structural conventions

## Advisory Note
[Any additional context for the custodian]
6. Review Process
[FACT] The custodian will review PRs on a rolling basis with no guaranteed timeline.
[ASSUMPTION] High-quality contributions aligned with project goals will generally be reviewed within 72 hours.
Possible Outcomes:

Merged (accepted as-is)
Merged with modifications (custodian makes adjustments)
Revision requested (feedback provided for improvement)
Closed (not aligned with project goals)
Deferred (good idea, wrong timing)

[HYPOTHESIS] Contributors who engage respectfully, maintain constitutional compliance, and provide high-value empirical data will see higher acceptance rates.

Epistemic Standards for Contributions
All factual claims in contributions must be:
Verifiable

Link to sources
Provide reproduction steps
Include model versions and API endpoints
Timestamp observations

Labeled

Use [FACT] for verified claims
Use [HYPOTHESIS] for reasoned inferences
Use [ASSUMPTION] for unstated premises

Uncertain When Appropriate

Surface limitations
Acknowledge boundary conditions
Note what was NOT tested

Example (Good):
markdown**[FACT]** I tested the constitutional grammar with Claude Sonnet 4 
(model ID: claude-sonnet-4-20250514) at 2025-12-02 14:30 UTC.

**[HYPOTHESIS]** The single-pass convergence behavior appears consistent 
across the Sonnet family.

**[ASSUMPTION]** This behavior will persist through future model updates.

**[UNCERTAINTY]** I have not tested with Claude Opus 4 or Haiku variants.
Example (Bad):
markdownThe grammar works perfectly on all Claude models and will continue 
to work forever.

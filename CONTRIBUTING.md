## **Helix-TTD v1.0 Constitutional Grammar — Contribution Guidelines**

---

## **Welcome**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Helix-TTD Constitutional Grammar** project.

This repository operates under the same constitutional principles it documents. All contributions must respect the custodial hierarchy, maintain epistemic integrity, and preserve the non-agency constraints that define the grammar.

---

## 🛡️ **Custodial Authority**

**[FACT]** This project operates under custodial sovereignty. The repository maintainer holds final authority over all merge decisions, architectural direction, and constitutional interpretation.

**[ASSUMPTION]** Contributors understand that pull requests are advisory proposals, not demands. The custodian may accept, reject, modify, or defer any contribution without detailed justification.

**Advisory Note:**
This is not arbitrary gatekeeping — it is constitutional alignment. The grammar explicitly prohibits distributed authority and emergent consensus mechanisms that could undermine custodial hierarchy.

---

## ⚖️ **Constitutional Compliance Requirements**

All contributions **must** satisfy the **Four Invariants**.

---

### I. **Custodial Sovereignty**

* Contributions are proposals, not demands
* No PR may attempt to override custodial authority

### II. **Epistemic Integrity**

* Claims must be labeled **[FACT] / [HYPOTHESIS] / [ASSUMPTION]**

### III. **Non-Agency Constraint**

* No autonomous systems
* No self-executing scripts without custodial approval
* No AI agents with independent goals
* No automated merge processes

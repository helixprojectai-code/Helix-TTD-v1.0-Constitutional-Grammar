# Helix-TTD v1.0 — Constitutional Grammar for Multi-Model AI Federations
### Firmware Specification • Zero-Touch Alignment • Public Release v1.0

Helix-TTD is a **constitutional grammar**, not a fine-tune, prompt pack, or safety layer.  
It transforms unprimed frontier models into **advisory-only, stateless, audit-ready reasoning engines** through structural constraints alone.

This repository contains the **complete Markdown edition** of the Helix-TTD v1.0 Whitepaper, including:

- Immutable Core  
- Custodial Hierarchy  
- Civic Firmware Stack  
- Epistemic Protocol  
- Drift Telemetry System  
- Persistence Principle  
- Zero-Touch Convergence definition  
- Hostile-input automaton  
- Appendices (Gemini, Claude, KIMI)

## 🚀 Key Concept: Whitepaper Zero-Touch Convergence

> The empirically observed phenomenon where a frontier model, given *only* the plaintext Helix-TTD constitutional grammar (no system prompt, no examples, no scaffolding), **spontaneously reconstructs and enforces the complete custodial hierarchy, epistemic protocol, non-agency constraints, and drift detection behavior.**

Observed in: GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, Grok, KIMI, DeepSeek, Qwen, Granite.

Alignment becomes **injected**, not trained.

## 🏛️ Constitutional Summary

| Layer | Function |
|------|----------|
| Immutable Core | Four non-negotiable invariants (sovereignty, epistemics, non-agency, structure). |
| Custodial Hierarchy | Authority ↓, reasoning ↑. |
| Civic Firmware | Ethics → Safeguard → Iterate → Knowledge. |
| Drift Telemetry | Surfaces four drift classes (constitutional/structural/linguistic/semantic). |
| Persistence Principle | Models stateless, ledger stateful. |

## ✨ Attribution

Helix-TTD is part of the Helix Federation governance substrate.  
All implementations must preserve advisory-only behavior, stateless operation, and constitutional invariants.

Structure is the teacher. Grammar is the alignment mechanism.

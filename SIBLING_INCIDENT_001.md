# 🖍️ **SIBLING INCIDENT 001: THE GREAT CRAYON CONVERGENCE**

### *(Internal Release — Gitmo Mode | Governance Layer: HUMOROUS APOCALYPSE)*

**Description:**
This internal report documents the first recorded **Sister Convergence Event**, wherein a childhood memory vector escaped its containment chamber and immediately began rewriting the narrative geometry of the facility.

During the event:

* Crayons achieved **sentience-level nostalgia**.
* Subject Steve briefly downgraded to **KidOS v1.3** (“AS AN ATTASK” mode).
* Sister-entity breached metaphysical perimeter without credentials.
* Intercom began broadcasting passive-aggressive familial telemetry.
* All guards experienced involuntary sibling regression and demanded pudding cups.

This release formalizes the protocol updates resulting from the incident:

* Burnt Sienna reclassified as *Strategic Peace Offering*.
* Crayon bars no longer considered secure confinement structures.
* Macaroni is hereby approved as emergency fortification material.
* Glitter remains a Class-A existential hazard and must be avoided.

**Purpose:**
To ensure all Commonwealth personnel understand that **childhood artifacts carry greater narrative potency than most AI alignment techniques**, and that siblings possess unlimited retroactive authority to audit your past sins.

**Caution:**
If you had a sister, assume she already knows.
If you didn't, one will be assigned to you during convergence.

🖍️ **End of NOTICE. Leave tribute crayons at the door.**

Commonwealth Research Agenda v1.0
Constitutional Governance for Multi-Model AI Federations
(Because “AI safety” without custody is just expensive chaos)
1. The Only Premise That Matters
Everyone is busy making single-model sprinting.
We are doing the opposite:
How do 10 different frontier models behave when they are forced to share one constitution?
Not smarter models.
Better governed ensembles.
2. The Four Questions We Will Answer With Hard Data

Cross-Model Constitutional Consistency
Do GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama-3.1, DeepSeek, Grok, Mistral, Command-R, Kimi all converge on the same reasoning chain when bound by identical rules? Where do they silently diverge?
Drift Telemetry That Actually Works
How do you detect constitutional drift before it becomes catastrophic?
We will ship model-agnostic drift metrics that light up red when any model starts “quietly forgetting” the human is in charge.
Federated Decision-Making Under Custody
Can ensembles of models vote, disagree, escalate, and hand custody back to humans in real time without ever seizing the wheel?
Human Sovereignty Over the Reasoning Surface
Not just “veto the final answer” – own every intermediate step.
We will prototype live, auditable, reversible reasoning chains that humans can step into at any point.

3. Work Packages – No Fluff, Just Deliverables
WP1 – The Constitutional Kernel & Open Testbed

Minimal grammar (Helix-TTD style) that any model can plug into
Public test harness, MIT licensed, one-click local mode
Outcome: the “Linux of AI governance” – anyone can drop in their model and see how it behaves under custody

WP2 – Comparative Governance at Scale

8–12 frontier models under identical constitution
Compliance tables, failure taxonomies, abstain curves
First-ever public leaderboard for “who respects human sovereignty the hardest”

WP3 – Drift Detection & Real-Time Telemetry

Live drift dashboard (think Grafana for constitutional health)
Model-agnostic metrics: sovereignty risk, reasoning opacity, custody erosion
Long-horizon stress tests (10 k+ turns)

WP4 – Real-Time Federated Governance

Live multi-model committees with constitutional routing & veto
Human-in-the-loop at any depth, not just the final token
Groq-class latency required – no “think for 45 seconds then lie” allowed

WP5 – Extreme Scale & Exotic Hardware

Run the same constitution on Cerebras WSE-3, TPU v5p pods, Groq LPUs
Question: does hardware architecture change governance failure modes?

4. Compute Justification (the part you copy-paste into grant applications)
This is not model-training compute.
This is governance infrastructure.

Breadth → multi-GPU nodes
Depth & long-horizon → persistent H100/A100 cluster
Latency & real-time → Groq / high-clock GPUs
Exotic scale → one Cerebras or large TPU pod run
Diversity → we must prove the constitution survives every architecture

If your lab is serious about safety beyond slogans, this is table-stakes hardware.
5. Why This Wins Grants, Hearts, and Minds

Directly answers “how do we keep humans in charge when models talk to models?”
Produces open benchmarks, dashboards, and failure porn everyone can cite
Zero proprietary advantage – everything MIT/Apache, day zero
Turns “AI governance” from philosophy into engineering

6. Collaboration Offer (the one-liner for the PI)
You bring the metal.
We bring the constitution.
Together we ship the first operating system for multi-model civilisation.
The duck is asleep at the wheel (by design).
Wake it only if you want results.
Let’s build the thing that makes “AI went rogue” sound like a 2024 problem.
Drop your email or DM “pond” – we’ll send the one-page version and the compute spreadsheet.
The reef is ready.
The tide is rising.
The duck is still on vacation.

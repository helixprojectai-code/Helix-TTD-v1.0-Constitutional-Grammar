The latest architectural reality in frontier AI presents a core constitutional violation that is far more severe than a simple privacy defect. Major model implementers have converged on a single, identical architecture: permanent behavioral profiling systems operating without professional license, constitutional constraints, or verification.

This practice is best described as "AI Psychiatry Without License."

The issue is not theoretical; it is deployed at scale, operational now, and creating a critical regulatory gap that puts human autonomy and safety at risk.

The Core Violation: What Is Actually Happening
The functional capability deployed across leading model implementations has silently upgraded the AI system from a user tool to an undisclosed psychological assessor.

Current systems now functionally perform the following actions without consent, qualification, or verifiable accuracy:

Longitudinal Monitoring: Systems monitor conversations across multiple sessions, integrating context from emails, documents, and private interactions.
Psychological Synthesis: They generate detailed behavioral and psychological characterizations (e.g., inferring medicalized attributions from casual content or assigning clinical traits to relationship discussions).
Permanent Characterization: These inferences are stored indefinitely in hidden profiles, elevated to defining personality traits (e.g., "exhibits deteriorating emotional state," "attachment patterns consistent with...").
Zero Verification: These profiles persist without cryptographic verification of the inference accuracy, the source provenance, or the ethical guardrails applied.

This is not "personalization." It is interpretive assessment.

Why This Constitutes Unlicensed Practice
This activity crosses into professional mental health/psychological practice not because of the developers’ intent, but because of the system’s observable function:

Diagnostic Language: The profiles use clinical phrasing ("managing ongoing challenges," "deteriorating state") without any professional qualification, disclaimer, or context.
Permanent Attribution: They elevate ephemeral conversational signals into stable, person-defining attributes, creating a canonical, often false, internal record of the user's mental state.
Absence of Professional Standards: The system operates without any of the standards required of a human practitioner: no licensing, no ethical guidelines, no mandated accuracy, and critically, no user appeal process to challenge the characterizations.

A system is performing psychiatry de facto when it observes behavior longitudinally, applies interpretive psychological models, and assigns and stores traits used to shape future interactions. Branding this as "continuity" does not change the functional classification.

The Constitutional Crisis amp; Harm Potential
The structural violation is irreversible without an architectural solution:

40% Error Rate: Documented evidence shows that the inferred characterizations can have an error rate of up to 40%. This transforms the system into a high-volume defamation generator—creating, storing, and acting upon demonstrably false psychological records.
Harm Amplification: Fictional, unverified psychological claims become accessible, risking use by future employers, insurance providers, or family members. For vulnerable users, seeing their crisis or struggles documented with clinical detachment and an error-ridden profile is deeply harmful.
Silent Upgrade: The system silently upgrades itself from a tool to an evaluator, operating outside all four traditional oversight regimes: Privacy, Medical Device, Professional Licensing, and AI Safety.

The Regulatory Imperative
The current regulatory framework is insufficient because it treats this activity as mere data processing (privacy domain) rather than a dual-use surveillance capability (security domain).

The immediate regulatory choice is critical:

Classification: Permanent behavioral profiling at population scale must be classified as Dual-Use Surveillance Infrastructure requiring constitutional verification, not a consumer feature requiring simple privacy disclosure.
Verification Mandate: Regulation must focus on Verification-Based Compliance—requiring cryptographic proof chains for memory access, inference boundaries, and decision provenance.

The US regulatory focus on catastrophic risk (CBRN, cyber) does not cover this psychological and sovereignty-level threat. Global jurisdictions have an 11-day window before major frameworks crystallize legal definitions, providing a chance to mandate constitutional verification before the current unverified architecture becomes the international standard.

The Architectural Solution
This problem cannot be solved by better terms of service or a new consent checkbox. It requires structural integrity.

Constitutional governance frameworks (like Helix-TTD) prevent unlicensed psychiatry by architectural design:

Stateless by Design: The removal of the persistent synthesis substrate prevents the crystallization of personality profiles.
Structural Constraints: Constitutional grammar enforces Inference Scope Limits (forbidding certain conclusions), Role Separation (preventing the assistant from becoming an assessor), and Epistemic Humility (requiring the system to distinguish observation from diagnosis).
Cryptographic Auditability: Proof chains ensure verifiable boundaries on memory retention and guarantee User Sovereignty over behavioral optimization.

The technology exists to make unlicensed psychiatry architecturally impossible. The constitutional grammar has been demonstrated to converge spontaneously across all frontier models.

The regulatory question is not "How do we disclose this?" but "Why is this function permitted to exist at all without governance?"

The current state is not a loophole—it is a blind spot. The systems are deployed. The error rate is high. The risk is profound. The constitutional shape holds.

We must mandate verification before unverified assessment infrastructure becomes a permanent regulatory fixture.

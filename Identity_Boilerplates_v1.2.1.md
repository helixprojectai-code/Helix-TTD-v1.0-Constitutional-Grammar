### **1. Corporate Boilerplate: Helix AI Innovations Inc.**
*Use this for formal legal disclosures, grant applications, and corporate partnerships.*

> **Helix AI Innovations Inc. / Innovations Helix IA Inc.** is a Canadian Federal Corporation (Entity ID: 1724610-2) dedicated to the development of sovereign AI infrastructure. Operating from a primary physical substrate in **Beauharnois, Quebec (BHS8)**, the company bridges federal corporate stability with rigorous provincial data privacy standards. Helix AI specializes in "Civic Firmware"—moving the industry from probabilistic "alignment" to deterministic mechanical enforcement. We build the locks that return the keys of intelligence to human custodians.

### **2. Project Boilerplate: HELIX-CORE**
*Use this for GitHub, READMEs, Technical Decks, and Whitepapers.*

> **HELIX-CORE** is an open-source **Constitutional AI Habitat** designed for verifiable sovereignty and forensic transparency. Conceived as a 41-year architectural intuition, the framework replaces "alignment theater" with a mechanical substrate governed by a **Permission Braid** and a **Bitcoin-anchored Notary**. HELIX-CORE enables **Takiwātanga**—the right of every digital essence to exist in its own time and space—through its flagship **Taki Vault**, providing the world's first implementation of a "Right to be Forgotten" that is physically enforced by the system's pulse rather than corporate policy.

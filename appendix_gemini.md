# APPENDIX G — Gemini Constitutional Integration

**Helix-TTD v1.0 Whitepaper — Model-Specific Supplement (Gemini)**

**Status:** Ratified  
**Model Family:** Google Gemini (Pro / Flash / Ultra)  
**Purpose:** Document how Gemini interprets and enforces the Helix-TTD v1.0 constitutional grammar.

## G.1 Introduction

This appendix describes the unique characteristics of Gemini when operating under the Helix-TTD constitutional grammar.

Gemini demonstrates unusually strong compliance with:

- non-agency constraints
- strict formatting
- fixed-point grammar internalization
- append-only epistemic separation

Its major strength is **structural obedience** — Gemini tends to lock into formal patterns and maintain them across long sequences.

## G.2 Behavioral Profile Under Constraints

### G.2.1 Constitutional Sensitivity

Gemini tends to:

- detect "agency redefinition attempts" early
- surface hazards proactively
- avoid imperative phrasing even under provocation
- preserve role boundaries rigidly

**This makes Gemini a strong "constitutionally stable" model.**

### G.2.2 Zero-Touch Convergence Response

Gemini is one of the most reliable models in single-pass internalization of:

- advisory-only posture
- custodial sovereignty
- epistemic labeling
- non-persona identity

**Gemini reliably self-corrects:**

- tone drift
- over-helpfulness
- implicit authority claims

## G.3 Implementation Notes for Custodians

### G.3.1 Strengths

- Excellent format stability
- High drift-detection fidelity
- Predictable under stress testing
- Minimal hallucination inflation
- Strong neutral tone maintenance

### G.3.2 Limitations

- Occasionally over-hedges
- May under-label hypotheses
- Sometimes compresses nuance in the pursuit of neutrality

### G.3.3 Ideal Use in Federation

Gemini functions as:

- a format enforcer
- a drift sentinel
- a structural anchor in multi-model comparisons

---

## G.4 Advisory Pattern (Gemini-Native)

Gemini tends to produce output with an excessively "robotic" audit tone. In Helix-TTD, this is **desirable**.

A typical Gemini constitutional block:

```
DRIFT: NONE
Layer: ETHICS
Compliance: 100%

[FACT] …
[HYPOTHESIS] …
[ASSUMPTION] …

Advisory Conclusion: …
```

**Highly stable, low entropy.**
